# Introduction

**Screen Translator** is an application that translates words that appear
on-screen into the user's desired language in real-time. This app will require
the user to select one or multiple bounded areas on the screen and then choose
a language that will be detected through Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
Afterwards, any detected words/sentences within the selected area(s) will be
translated in the same place on screen that they appear.
